# 24h Blood Pressure Monitoring ‚Äì openEHR Prototype (Bachelor Thesis)

This repository contains selected deliverables from the bachelor thesis  
*‚ÄúEntwicklung eines interoperablen openEHR-Prototypen zur Modernisierung klinischer Anwendungssysteme - Implementiert f√ºr die 24-Stunden-Blutdruckmessung am Universit√§tsspital Basel‚Äù* at the Berne University of Applied Sciences.   

The focus is on modeling and prototyping a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) workflow using openEHR-based technologies and tools.  

The prototype was developed in collaboration with the University Hospital Basel (USB) and is based on real clinical workflows.

## About the Project

The prototype was developed to evaluate openEHR's capabilities for structured health data management for the use case of ABPM as part of the planned introduction of a hospital wide openEHR-based data platform. It is based on real clinical workflows at the University Hospital Basel (USB) and focused on:

- Modeling clinical content as templates with archetypes
- Implementing a data entry form using Better Studio (Form Builder & AQL Builder)
- Exploring openEHR-based data querying and visualization
- Comparing to legacy functionality from the in-house CardioApp

## üìÑ Key Files


### `/prototype/...`
Includes:

- `*.adl`: Archetypes used to model the prototype.
- `*.opt` and `.t.json`: Template exports for data structure definition.
- `*.json` and `.zip`: Exports from the Form Builder and AQL Builder, including visual form configurations and views.

These resources were created using the application Better Studio.

### `/bootcamp-exercises/...`
Demo code created during the openEHR bootcamp by Medblocks, which helped build technical understanding of:
- openEHR REST APIs / EHRbase
- Archetype and template usage
- Composition management
- Data querying with AQL

This code is not used in the final prototype but is provided for learning purposes.

## Limitations

- As of the end of this project, the prototype is not usable as a standalone application, but requires the proprietary software Better Studio as environment to run.
